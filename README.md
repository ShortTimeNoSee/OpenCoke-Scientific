# OpenCoke-Scientific
## Recipe Version: Jan 16, 2026

This repository contains the most chemically accurate, open-source recreation of modern Coca-Cola ever published. Unlike "OpenCola" or the 1886 "Pemberton" recipes, this version is based on modern Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis to identify the exact terpenoids and aromatic compounds used in the current commercial formula.

⚠️ SAFETY WARNING
- 85% Phosphoric Acid is highly corrosive. It will cause chemical burns to skin and eyes. Wear gloves and eye protection.
- Undiluted Essential Oils are powerful solvents. Use glass or stainless steel measuring tools; they will dissolve many types of plastic.
- 95% Ethanol is highly flammable. Do not use near open flames or sparking equipment.

## The Methodology
Most clones fail because they rely on historical guesses (Neroli, Lavender, Clove). Through mass spectrometry, we identified that modern Coke achieves its "leafy" freshness through 4-terpineol and Fenchol, and its mouthfeel through Wine Tannins.

Furthermore, the "secret" flavor is both the ingredients AND the Acid-Catalyzed Hydrolysis of the syrup, a heating step that converts sucrose into invert sugar and modifies the citrus terpenes to remove the "furniture polish" taste.

## The Recipe

### I. Phase 1: The "7X" Essential Oil Concentrate
This creates the raw aromatic core (~100mL). Combine in a glass jar:

| Ingredient | Quantity | Note |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Lemon Oil (Cold Pressed) | 45.8 mL | |
| Lime Oil (Distilled) | 36.5 mL | |
| Tea Tree Oil | 8.0 mL | Source of 4-terpineol; replaces "coca" freshness |
| Cassia Cinnamon Oil | 4.5 mL | |
| Nutmeg Oil | 2.7 mL | |
| Orange Oil (Sweet) | 1.2 mL | |
| Coriander Oil | 0.7 mL | |
| Fenchol (Isolate) | 0.6 mL | Melt in hot water before measuring |

**Side Note:** If Fenchol isolate is unavailable, high-quality Fennel Oil can be used, though it is less chemically precise.

**Aging:** Seal and rest for 24–48 hours to allow esterification.

### II. Phase 2: Flavor Solution A (Ethanol Carrier)
1. Measure **20 mL** of the aged "7X" Oil.
2. Dilute to **1 Liter** using **95% Food-Grade Ethanol**.
**Side Note:** For an alcohol-free version, use Gum Arabic to create a water-emulsion with a high-shear blender.

### III. Phase 3: Flavor Solution B (Water-Based Base)
Dissolve in ~200mL hot water, then dilute to **1 Liter** total:

- **9.65 g** Caffeine Anhydrous
- **160 g** Glycerin (Provides "body")
- **45 mL** Phosphoric Acid (85% Food Grade)
- **10 mL** Distilled White Vinegar (5% Acidity)
- **10 g** Wine Tannins (For astringency)
- **10 mL** Vanilla Extract
- **190 mL** Durkee Caramel Color
**Side Note:** Durkee is preferred as it is stronger than Shank's. If you must use Shank's, increase volume to ~320 mL.

## Assembly (Per 1 Liter of Soda)

1. **The Syrup:** Combine **104g Sugar**, **10mL Solution B**, and **1mL Solution A** with a small amount of water.
2. **The Heat Treatment:** Microwave or heat until nearly boiling. Cover immediately to trap volatiles. This step is mandatory for flavor development.
3. **Carbonation:** Once cool, dilute the syrup with **Cold Carbonated Water** to the 1-Liter mark.
4. **Final Rest:** Refrigerate for 24 hours before drinking to let the CO2 and flavors unify.

## Variations

### "Mexican" Coke Style
If you prefer the profile of glass-bottle "Mexican" Coke, increase the **Lime Oil** ratio in the final mix. While the exact chemical difference hasn't been strictly isolated, increasing the lime note approximates this profile best.
